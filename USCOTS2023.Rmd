##  Motivation and Goals

The motivation of this activity is to encourage communicating these abstract topics with an interactive investigation focused on visuals that enhance intuition and understanding. To be specific:


- Two commonly taught convergence concepts: in distribution and in probability will be demonstrated through the use of interactive Shiny Applications

-These tools allow for multiple random sequences with known features to be simulated and the behavior changes of the random sequences to be explored through visual representations

-Any users can take advantage of this visualization tool without needing knowledge of any programming language

-Users can share this app with students and peers which promotes collaborations

## The idea of Convergence in Distribution 

-   Compare the *actual* distribution and approximating distribution <br><br>
-   Do the cumulative density distributions match when the sample size is large?
-  Explore: simulate sample mean by creating many *realizations* of $\bar{Y}$ where $Y\sim Gamma (\alpha, \lambda)$ <br>

## Central Limit Theorem Applied to a Sample Proportion

CLT application - the sample proportion from a Binomial distribution

-   If $X_i\stackrel{iid}\sim Bin(1, p)$ with mean $E(Y) = p$ and variance $Var(Y) = p(1-p)$
-   $\bar{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i}{n} = \frac{Y}{n}\stackrel{\bullet}\sim N(p, p(1-p)/n)$

## Convergence in Probability Ideas

We want to understand the behavior of the sequence $X_n$ as n grows.

-   $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}P(-\epsilon < X_n < \epsilon) =0, \forall \epsilon>0$
-   Visualize the **sample paths** of $X_n$
-   Assume that $Y_i\stackrel{iid}\sim N(0,1)$, and let $X_n = \frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_i$
-   $X_n\stackrel{p}\rightarrow 0$

## Explore Convergence in Probability 
Suppose we have a random sample $Y\sim N (10,1)$:

-  What does $W = (\bar{Y})^2$ converges to in probability?
